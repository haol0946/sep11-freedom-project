##### 11/2/24 Deciding the tool and project


### Context

Since September, we have been in Stage One, also known as the EDP, or Engineering Design Process phase. This phase essentially involves identifying a problem and reaching a point where you can solve it. My specific problem involves something you likely have near you at this
very moment: your phone. You might be asking, how exactly is this a problem? Well, built into every modern phone is a camera that is just a couple of seconds away. This feature is what allows me, my friends, and every one else to capture fond memories at a momentâ€™s notice.
However, as phones become more advanced, the need to learn how to utilize these features diminishes, as they become increasingly automated. While this may seem like a great advancement to many and it is- it also strips away the fundamentals of photography for anyone interested.

### Content : The tool for this project & what im going to do with it

## 1. What tool I decided to use
The tool I decided to use was P5 play as it is an extension to P5 which we are learning on later in the year but adds physics and as I was conducting my initial research on tools I saw games with similar styles to my vison (2D Platformers) so I decided to use it as my tool as
a means to bring my vision to life.

    P5.Play - A javascript library that makes it easier to create games
    * Features
        * Sprites : Create, manipulate, and animate 2D images
        * Collision : Methods to detect collisions between sprites
        * Physics : Basic physics allowing for dynamic and realistic movement
        * User input : Simple way to handle keyboard and mouse inputs

## 2. What I'm going to make
So, what I decided to create is a mash-up of my original ideas: teaching people the basics of photography through the exposure triangle ISO, shutter speed, and aperture which each manipulate the photo in different ways. I envisioned a 2D platformer similar to Mario, where
players navigate levels and collect currency, combined with an escape room element. In this game, you first progress through the 2D platformer, collecting currency throughout the levels. Once you reach the 'End,' you enter the escape room, where you must use the currency,
the knowledge you gained along the way, and hints to edit photos and ultimately escape. This approach teaches the basics of photography in a fun and less daunting way.

### Skills : One skill I've learned/grown

* How to properly google. Although this seems quite a simple and basic task/skill to do google only allows you search for very broad topics and for this I had project in the beginning I was researching how to incorperate a photo editor using Javascript trying to google very
specfic things only to realize that the idea most likely wasn't going to work out in the long run. However as I went onto my backup ideas of platformers and an escape room I had to continually look for ways to incorperate these ideas together eventually realizing I would be
able to combine my ideas together using P5 play and the photo editor.
